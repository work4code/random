You must have the cvs-git plugin installed; on Fedora this can be done by installing the git-cvs package: yum install git-cvs cvsps (the cvsps utility is required to create the CVS patchsets). Once this is done, you can point Git to a CVS repository:

$ git cvsimport -v -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/classpath classpath


$ git diff [new_revision] [old_revision]
